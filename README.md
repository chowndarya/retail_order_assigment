# retail_order_assigment

This is a key element of retail order fulfillment, where reliability and accuracy lead to customer satisfaction.

Design and implement an order processing API using Spring boot with any NoSQL data source of your choice.
•                 Push the order details to a message queue and also create a record in the data source with the order status PLACED.
•                 Use a separate consumer which will process the order message and update the data source with its order status as PROCESSED.
•                 Use Get API to fetch the order status. Secure the GET API.

Use OOPs concepts, design patterns and suitable data structures as applicable for your use case. Use async/sync mechanisms wherever necessary. Check in the code to GIT repo and share the link. Follow coding standards and unit testing frameworks.
